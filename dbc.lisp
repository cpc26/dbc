;;; Design by Contract in Common Lisp.
;;; =================================

;;; One of the outstanding features of the Eiffel language is that it
;;; supports a concept called Design by Contract.  A comprehensive
;;; description is given in the following books
;;;
;;; Object Oriented Software Construction, 2nd ed.
;;; Bertrand Meyer
;;; Prentice Hall PTR, 1997
;;; ISBN 0-13-629155-4
;;;
;;; Eiffel: The Language, 2nd ed.
;;; Bertrand Meyer
;;; Prentice Hall PTR, 1992
;;; ISBN ???
;;;
;;; but the key point of DBC is that the relationship between a class
;;; and its clients is specified by a contract: There are certain
;;; conditions that the caller of a method specialized on a class has
;;; to fulfill so that the method can do its job (the preconditions)
;;; and the method guarantees certain things after its completion (the
;;; postconditions).  Furthermore a class may have certain properties
;;; that are always true about that class; these properties are called
;;; invariants.
;;;
;;; This file contains an implementation of DBC for CLOS.  Pre- and
;;; postconditions as well as invariants are specified by qualified
;;; methods of type dbc; the usual before, after and around method
;;; combinations are available for these methods as well.
;;;
;;; Example:
;;; =======
;;;
;;; (defpackage "DBC-TEST"
;;;   (:use "DBC" "CL")
;;;   (:shadowing-import-from "DBC"
;;;                          "DEFCLASS" "MAKE-INSTANCE" "DBC"))
;;;
;;; (in-package "DBC-TEST")
;;;
;;; (defclass test () 
;;;   ((slot1 :accessor slot1 :initarg :slot1 :initform 0))
;;;   (:invariant (lambda (class) 
;;;	 	(format t "~& >> Invariant check for class ~A~%"
;;;		 	class)
;;;		( numberp (slot-value class 'slot1)))))
;;;
;;; (defgeneric test-dbc (arg1 arg2) (:method-combination
;;;                                   dbc
;;;				      :invariant-check nil))
;;; (defmethod test-dbc :precondition "first arg zero" ((m test) (n test))
;;;   (format t "~& >> precondition (test test)~%")
;;;   (not (zerop (slot1 m))))
;;; (defmethod test-dbc ((m test) (n test))
;;;   (/ (slot1 n) (slot1 m)))
;;;
;;; (test-dbc (make-instance 'test) (make-instance 'test))
;;; (test-dbc (make-instance 'test :slot1 2) (make-instance 'test :slot1 8))


;;; Authors and Copyright.
;;; =====================
;;;
;;; The code was written by Matthias Hoelzl (tc@gauss.muc.de) and is
;;; placed in the public domain.  Rainer Joswig added the package
;;; definition and MCL patches.  The most recent version of this file
;;; should be available at
;;;
;;;    <http://www.muc.de/~hoelzl/tools/dbc/dbc.lisp>.
;;;
;;; Thanks to Rainer Joswig for pointing out errors and sending me
;;; notes on the design as well as MCL patches and to Douglas Thomas
;;; Crosher who found a bug in the definition of the method qualifier
;;; patterns.
;;;
;;; WARNING: This code is still in its very early stages and not
;;; suitable for production use.

;;; Change Log.
;;; ==========
;;;
;;; 1999-08-03  Matthias Hoelzl  <tc@gauss.muc.de>
;;;  * Removed the possibility to add a contract-specification-string
;;;    to pre- and postconditions for acl5 compatibility.
;;;  * Improved the output for pre- and postconditions without
;;;    descriptions.
;;; 1998-10-14  Matthias Hoelzl  <tc@gauss.muc.de>
;;;  * Fixed the qualifiers to use dotted lists as required by the
;;;    standard (thanks to Douglas Thomas Crosher for setting me
;;;    straight on this).
;;;  * Disabled the keyword arguments for PCL based implementations
;;;    so that the code compiles on them.
;;;
;;; 1998-10-13  Matthias Hoelzl  <tc@gauss.muc.de>
;;;  * Contract checks can now be disabled for each generic function
;;;    with the keyword arguments :precondition-check,
;;;    :postcondition-check and :invariant-check to the
;;;    :method-combination argument.  Unfortunately this breaks on
;;;    PCL-based implementations.
;;;
;;; 1998-10-12  Matthias Hoelzl  <tc@gauss.muc.de>
;;;  * Defined error classes so that contract violations can be
;;;    recognized and caught.
;;;  * Changed method combination type to allow descriptions
;;;    of the contract which are stored in the condition that
;;;    is signalled when the contract is violated.
;;;  * Changed defclass to allow :invariant functions to be
;;;    preceeded by a descriptive string.
;;;  * Features :dbc-precondition-checks, :dbc-postcondition-checks
;;;    and :dbc-invariant-checks must be present for the checks to
;;;    be enabled at compile time.
;;;  * `define-slot-accessor-invariants' takes additional
;;;    description argument.
;;;  * `getf-and-remove' now returns the cdar of the found pair as
;;;    first argument and not the cadar.
;;;
;;; 1998-10-11  Matthias Hoelzl  <tc@gauss.muc.de>
;;;  * Added default method for `check-invariant'.
;;;  * Removed `(ensure-generic-function 'check-invariant)' from
;;;    `define-check-invariant-method'.
;;;  * Changed method combination type of `check-invariant' to
;;;    standard method combination.
;;;
;;; 1998-10-11  Rainer Joswig
;;;  * Added package definition.
;;;  * Added MCL patches.
;;;
;;; 1998-10-07  Matthias Hoelzl  <tc@gauss.muc.de>
;;;  * Initial version.
;;;  * Changed handling of pre-/postconditions and invariants to
;;;    match Eiffel's behavior more closely.  Errors are now signalled
;;;    by the method combination.
